## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Pure CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API
- Pure JS class components

### What I learned

For the first time, I utilized vanilla JS (without React) in a project to add interactivity. I also employed classes to dynamically create components based on data acquired with the fetch function.

I have become quite confident in writing HTML and CSS and have only encountered a few situations where I needed to search the web for documentation or assistance. This project was completed in only two evenings, which is much faster than my previous pace.
